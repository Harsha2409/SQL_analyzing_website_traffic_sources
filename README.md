### Concept: Traffic Source Analysis

It is all about understanding where your customers come from and which of those channels are driving the highest quality traffic.

In real world, we'd be looking at e-mail social media search direct traffic and then we're gonna be looking at conversion rates which is the percentage of those sessions which convert to our sales or revenue activity.
We do the conversion rate analysis so that we can understand how highly qualified that traffic is and how valuable each of those traffic sources is to us.

#### Common use cases of traffic source nalysis are:
- analyzing search data and shifting budgets towards one engine or another looking at different campaigns or keywords to see which have the best conversion rates.
- comparing user behavior patterns across different traffic sources and we can look for opportunities to eliminate wasted spend within paid marketing channels.
- We can also look at channels which are performing very well so that we can try to scale those up.
